<h1>Elias Vehikite: Welcome to my page!</h1>

<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>Hello! My name is Elias Vehikite. I am a 21 year-old cybersecurity major from Indiana. I enjoy powerlifting, watching documentaries, and spending time with my friends. I also speak spanish.</p>

<h3>Education-</h3>
<p>I attended Elwood Community Jr. Sr. High School where I earned my high school diploma. While there I also participated in track and field, served as president of the student council, and maintained a position as one of the top students in my class. I was accepted to Brigham Young University following high school and I began my freshman year studying Political Science. I then served a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. Following my return from my mission I decided to pursue a new path and I beagn to study cybersecurity.</p>

<h3>Family-</h3>
<P>I come from a faimly of seven. My mother and father, my four sisters, and me. I am the 4th child. My mom and dad have been married for more than 25 years. My second oldest sister recently was married and that added a 8th member to our family. My family is very important for me.</P>
 
<h3>Faith-</h3>
<p>I am a child of God, a child of the covenant, and a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. I know that Jesus Christ is my Savior. I know that Heavenly Father loves me. I served a mission in Buenos Aires, Argentina and I was able to take the restored gospel of Jesus Christ to the people of that land. Through this I came to know that the Church of Jesus Christ offeres the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. I know that the Book of Mormon is the word of God. </p>
